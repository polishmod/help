# H.E.L.P - Health Environment for Living in Pandemia

## Inspiration  

What drives us is a feeling of deep-rooted passion and motivation to deliver solutions that can save people's lives. We serve for people as military IT specialists that is why we have decided that we can apply our experiences and knowledge to solve some crucial problems – tracking and analysis of pandemia using wide spread mobile devices.  

As cybersecurity and decision support specialists we have captured an idea how to help us avoid pandemia risks, connected with the movement of citizens. Secure and seamless monitoring of our location, with medical diagnostics can help the authorities to identify clusters of infections. 

Recently, we realised that we don't know where infected people might be to keep away from those areas. Many people have doubts have they been infected, and are there any risks in their neighbourhood. That inspired us to create the H.E.L.P. application. 

 

## What it does 

Our solution is based on a combination of mobile and web application. Whenever you wonder you might have been infected, you simply fill a survey about your condition, send it and within seconds you will receive a diagnose. 

If a risks of infection is detected, the system using spatial reasoning will identify possible people at risk and notify them about such a threat. Accordingly, people who might have contact with infected person will receive, a notification with generated map with risk areas and population density heat map. This way without the user  

Web application provides a Health Care Centre with the ability to display a Common Infection Picture on a map and support decision making process to stop spreading SARS-CoV-2. 

HELP technology detects cough sounds through the phone’s microphone during the examination process. AI algorithms analyze the sound using machine-learning, a kind of artificial intelligence that can “learn” to recognize patterns, in this case in the sound of an individual person’s cough.  

H.E.L.P. system takes care in particular for elderly people by utilizing Voice Guidance system across all functions available. 

## How we built it 

We have been working on analytical tools for decision and command support which strongly relies on algorithmic analysis of location tracking. The team also developed set of mobile biomedical tools for medical diagnostics that is why we are familiar with medical diagnostic procedure based on biopotential, image and sound recognition. The team has been composed of the computer scientists, AI researchers, mobile and web developers and IT officer cadets. This brings a wide variety of expertise and motivation to deliver innovative and unique product solving a crucial problem – tracking pandemic clusters – locations, facilities, people. 

System is composed on two main components a mobile application for users (people). 

## Challenges we ran into 

The main challenge for us was to develop a working solution in a very short time. Our goal was not only to implement functionalities itself but also to make a mobile and web application users-friendly and encouraging to use daily. 

Another difficulty was to implement a proper cough sound recording mechanism in a way that  
a doctor or AI algorithms can examine. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We managed to implement cross-platform working solution that provides a group of functionalities that truly address and improve spreading of SARS-CoV-2. An open architecture is ready for extensions with new capabilities related to the pandemia. 

## What we learned 

Whilst working under the time pressure we improved the team cohesion by using new Open Source Collaboration Software Tools. Moreover, development of H.E.L.P. let us understood the process that applies from condition gathering to diagnose for a single person. 

## What's next

Our goal is to add new functionalities to the H.E.L.P. system, in particular in the areas of: 

utilizing Artificial Intelligence for health conditions analysis, 

bringing situation awareness to the user regarding a help he can get from the Government and the Health Care System, 

enhance the web application with the virus-related data coming from OSINT.
